To predict future stock prices using past trends with LSTM, you can follow this concise mini-guide leveraging Python, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Yahoo Finance API (yfinance):

Step-by-Step Mini-Guide
1. Fetch Data Using yfinance API

Install and import yfinance.

Use yf.Ticker(ticker).history(start, end) or yf.download() to get historical stock prices.

2. Normalize and Prepare Data

Use Min-Max scaling or similar normalization on closing prices.

Create sequences of past prices as input features and next price as label.

Optionally, add technical indicators like moving averages and RSI to enrich features.

3. Build LSTM Model Using Keras

Define a sequential model with one or more LSTM layers and Dense output layer.

Compile with suitable loss (e.g., MSE) and optimizer (e.g., Adam)

4. Train and Validate Model

Split data into training and validation sets.

Train model with batches and epochs, monitoring loss decrease.

Use early stopping or learning rate decay to improve training.

5. Plot Predictions vs Actual

After training, predict on test data.

Plot actual vs predicted prices with Matplotlib to visualize performance.

Optionally, plot evolution of predictions over epochs.

6. Integrate Moving Average & RSI Indicators

Calculate moving averages (e.g., 20-day, 50-day) and RSI using Pandas or TA libraries.

Include these as additional input features to the LSTM to improve accuracy.

7. Optional: Deploy Dashboard with Streamlit

Build a simple Streamlit app to input stock ticker and show predictions interactively.

Use streamlit run app.py to launch locally or deploy online.

Deliverables
Jupyter notebook with data processing, model building, training, and visualization.

Saved model weights (.h5 file) for reuse.

Graphs comparing predicted vs actual prices.

Streamlit app link or code for interactive dashboard.

This approach combines data retrieval, feature engineering, LSTM modeling, and visualization, providing a robust pipeline for stock price trend prediction
